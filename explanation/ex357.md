Let $\mathbb{P}$ be the set of all primes. We need to find the sum of all $n\in\mathbb{N^{+}}, n\leq10^{8}$, of which for every divisor $d$ of $n$, there occurs $d+\frac{n}{d}\in\mathbb{P}$.
For a number $n$ to match our criteria, there needs:  
$\bullet\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }$ For all divisors of $n$; $d|n$, there must occur $d+\frac{n}{d}\in\mathbb{P}$.  
$-\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }$ Since $1,n$ are divisors of $n$, there must occur $d+\frac{n}{d} \xrightarrow{} 1+\frac{n}{1} \xrightarrow{} 1+n\in\mathbb{P}$. So $n+1$ must be prime. This reduces our range of search from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{P}-1$.  
$-\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }$ Since we now focus on $\mathbb{P}-1$, it is worth mentioning that all the numbers that answer the criteria are even. With the exception of $1$.  
$-\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }$ Since all primes above $10$ must end with a digit of $1,3,7,9$, we deduce that our numbers must end with a digit of $0,2,6,8$.  
$-\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }$ Since all numbers we seek must be even, then they must have $2$ as a divisor. That means that $d+\frac{n}{d} \xrightarrow{} 2+\frac{n}{2}\in\mathbb{P}$. This means $n\in2\cdot\mathbb{P}-4$, which is a smaller set than $\mathbb{P}-1$.  
  
We can now reduce our range of search to $n\in\{2\cdot\mathbb{P}-4\}\cap\{\mathbb{P}-1\}$, which includes $458,462$ numbers. (A dramatic reduction in comparison to the previous range of $10^{8}$ numbers).  
  
In the code below, we implement a variation of a known algorithm, Sieve of Eratosthenes, which lists primes below a certain limit, only we won't list the primes $\{p_{0},p_{1},p_{2},\cdots\}$ themselves, but rather $\{p_{0}-1,p_{1}-1,p_{2}-1,\cdots\}$ and $\{2p_{0} + 4,\text{ }2p_{1} + 4,\text{ }2p_{2} + 4,\cdots\}$, which is our reduced range of search.

```python
def range_of_search_siege_primes(n):
    sieve = [True] * (n+1)
    p=2
    ran1 = set()
    ran2 = set()
    while (p*p <=n): #Sieve to rule-out composite numbers.
        if (sieve[p]):
            for i in range(p*p, n+1, p):
                sieve[i] = False
        p+=1
    sieve[0]=False #0,1 aren't primes.
    sieve[1]=False

    for p in range(n+1):
        if sieve[p]: #Where p is prime, add 2*p-4 to set(1), p-1 to set(2).
            if 2 * p - 4 <= n:
                ran1.add(2 * p - 4)
            ran2.add(p - 1)
    return sorted(ran1.intersection(ran2)) #Return intersection.
```
 $\bullet\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }$ There is no need to check for each divisor $d$ in range $[1:n]$ if $d+\frac{n}{d}\in\mathbb{P}$ applies.  
$-\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }$ $d+\frac{n}{d}\in\mathbb{P}$ for $2,\frac{n}{2}, 1, n$ shouldn't be checked since our reduced range of search, $\{2\cdot\mathbb{P}-4\}\cap\{\mathbb{P}-1\}$, already includes such numbers.  
$-\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }$ We'll be using an algorithm known as trial division, trial divison checks for divisors of $n$ in a range of $[2:\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor+1]$. It exclaims that for each divisor $d$ of $n$, there exists another divisor, $\frac{n}{d}$.  
  
Iterating through the range $[3:\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor+1]$ for divisors of $n$, we'll only be needing to check $d$'s and skip their counterpart $\frac{n}{d}$'s, since $(d)+\frac{n}{(d)}=(\frac{n}{d})+\frac{n}{(\frac{n}{d})}=\frac{n}{d} + d$.

```python
def isPrime(n): #isPrime(n) is explained in my solution for ex 387.
    if n==2 or n==3: return True
    if n%2==0 or n<2: return False
    lim = int(n**0.5)+1
    for i in range(3, lim, 2):   # only odd numbers
        if n%i==0:
            return False
    return True

def divisors_of_n_prime(n):
    lim= int(n**0.5)+1
    for d in range(3,lim):
        if n%d==0:
            if not isPrime(d + (n/d)):
                return False
    return True
```
In the code below, we proceed to check our critireas for every $n\in\{2\cdot\mathbb{P}-4\}\cap\{\mathbb{P}-1\}$, $n\leq 10^{8}$.  

```python
def ex357():
    sum=1 #Including 1, which is the only exception to what we listed.
    pl = range_of_search_siege_primes(10**8)
    for n in pl:
        if divisors_of_n_prime(n):
            sum+=n
    return sum
```

As such, the sum of all such numbers is $1739023853137.$  
It takes the computer $22.908$ seconds to compute our range of search, and additional $32.842$ seconds to compute the sum. A total of $55.750$ seconds.
