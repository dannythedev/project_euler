## [*Project Euler 1 - Multiples of 3 or 5.*](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1 "Go to problem page.")
  
Instead of going over each $n \in \mathbb{N} \text{ } | \text{ } n < 1000$ and check if $n\text{ }mod\text{ }5 \vee n\text{ }mod\text{ }3$, it's much faster to make two seperate lists:  
$l1$ where $x$ starts off from $3$, repeatedly incremented by $3$, and added to $l1$ while $x < 1000$.  
$l2$ where $x$ starts off from $5$, repeatedly incremented by $5$, and added to $l2$ while $x < 1000$ and if $x\text{ }mod\text{ }3\neq0$ (to avoid duplicates from $l1$).  
$l1=[3,6,9,12,15\cdots],\text{ }l2=[5,10,20,25,35\cdots]$. We now calculate $sum(l1+l2)$.
```python
def ex1():
    return sum([x for x in range(3, 1000, 3)]+
               [x for x in range(5, 1000, 5) if not x % 3 == 0])
```

The sum of all numbers below $1000$ that are multiples of $3$ or $5$ is $233168$.  
  
It takes the computer a total of $0.0000782$ seconds to compute the answer.
