## *Project Euler 2 - Even Fibonacci numbers.*
The fibonacci sequence is $F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ where $F_{0}=0, F_{1}=1$. Meaning $F = [0,1,2,3,5,7,12 ...]$.
  
Let $fib(lim)$ generate all the even fibonacci members whose values are smaller than a given integer $lim$.  
Let $n1=0$, $n2=1$ be the first two members of the fibonacci sequence.  
As long as $n1+n2 < lim$, then $n1 \rightarrow n2$, and $n2 \rightarrow n1+n2$. We yield $n1+n2$ if it is an even number. Repeat until condition is broken.  

```python
def fib(lim):
    n1,n2=0,1
    while (n1+n2<lim):
        n1, n2 = n2, n1+n2
        yield n1+n2 if (n1+n2)%2==0 else 0
```

Let $ex2()$ calculate the sum of generator $fib(4000000)$.

```python
def ex2(lim=4000000):
    a = fib(lim)
    return sum(a)
```

As such, the sum of all even fibonacci numbers below $4000000$ is $4613732$.
  
It takes the computer a total of $0.00004.22$ seconds to compute the answer.
